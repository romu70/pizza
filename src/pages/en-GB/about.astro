    <p>Ciao! 👋</p>

    <p>I'm Romuald — a big-time foodie and a true pizza enthusiast.<br>
    Did you know? Pizza is the most eaten dish in the world. And honestly... it's easy to see why!</p>

    <p>I love eating a good pizza. But after a while, just eating them wasn’t enough.<br>
    So, three years ago, I decided to take the leap: time to make my own pizza at home!</p>

    <p>Dozens of attempts later — failed doughs, burnt crusts, doughs that refused to rise — I finally nailed down <strong>my own recipe</strong>, my own process. The result? A crust everyone around me absolutely loves. Mission accomplished!</p>

    <p>But one thing kept bugging me: <strong>having to recalculate ingredients every single time</strong>. Flour, water, salt, yeast... always doing the math.</p>

    <p>So I did what any dev who loves pizza would do — I built a little tool to make my life easier: <strong>coach.pizza</strong>.<br>
    It’s my personal dough assistant. You tell it what you want to make, and it gives you the exact quantities. Simple, convenient, no fuss.</p>

    <p>And since it works so well for me, I figured — why not share it?<br>
    If it saves you a few headaches and gets you closer to <strong>your perfect dough</strong>, that’s a win in my book.</p>

    <p>So here it is. Welcome to <strong>coach.pizza</strong> — and most importantly, <strong>happy pizza making 🍕(just don’t burn the crust 😉)</strong></p>
